## About Vibha

Hello! My name is Vibha, and I’m currently an 11th grader. Last year, I took the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course, which ignited my interest in technology and programming. This year, I’m thrilled to be diving deeper into software development and algorithms through AP Computer Science A (CSA).

I have hands-on experience with several technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and SQLite databases. I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and apply it to practical projects.

## Past CSP Projects

### Project 1: Profile Setter

**Overview:** This project involves a profile setter implemented using ASCII characters.

- **Backend:** This project features an SQLite backend with GET and POST requests for data handling.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQLite, Flask (for API)

### Project 2: Third Trimester Self-Care Project

**Overview:** This project was centered on self-care, combining elements from previous projects to create a comprehensive self-care application.

- **Self-Care Tracking:** Developed features to monitor various self-care activities such as meditation, journaling, and exercise.
- **Personalized Reminders:** Implemented a system that allows users to set personalized reminders based on their self-care routines.
- **Backend:** Used an SQLite database to store and retrieve data related to self-care activities.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite, Python

### Project 3: Third Trimester Stroke Prediction

**Overview:** This project was centered on the creation of a stroke prediction software based on user-inputted factors (hypertension, age, etc.)
- **Data Processing:** The dataset used for the creation of the model had to be cleaned to remove certain columns. 
- **Backend:** Used an SQLite database to store data related to a user's prediction and their inputted factors.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite, Python
