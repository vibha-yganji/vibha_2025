## About Vibha

Hello! My name is Vibha, and I’m currently an 11th grader. Last year, I took the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course, which ignited my interest in technology and programming. This year, I’m thrilled to be diving deeper into software development and algorithms through AP Computer Science A (CSA).

I have hands-on experience with several technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and SQLite databases. I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and apply it to practical projects.

## Past CSP Projects

### Project 1: Profile Setter 

**Overview:** This project was part of of an overarching fitness tracker. 

- **Profile**: I developed a 
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Local Storage, D3.js (for pie charts), SQLite, Python (for ML algorithms)

### Project 2: Profile Setter

**Overview:** This project involves a calorie burn calculator initially developed in Jupyter Notebooks using the Seaborn library, later implemented as a model and API.

- **Data Processing:** The project included one-hot encoding, data cleaning (removing empty values), data training, and predictions.
- **Backend:** Like the fitness tracker, this project features an SQLite backend with GET and POST requests for data handling.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQLite, Flask (for API)

### Project 3: Third Trimester Self-Care Project

**Overview:** This project was centered on self-care, combining elements from previous projects to create a comprehensive self-care application.

- **Self-Care Tracking:** Developed features to monitor various self-care activities such as meditation, journaling, and exercise.
- **Personalized Reminders:** Implemented a system that allows users to set personalized reminders based on their self-care routines.
- **Backend:** Used an SQLite database to store and retrieve data related to self-care activities.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQLite
